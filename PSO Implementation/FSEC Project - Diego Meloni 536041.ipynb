        "## Notes on the implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "A few small changes have been made for compatibility and to ensure the code runs correctly, with the optimizer behaving as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Correction of the update formula  \n",
        "   - The formula written in the project's specifications used `(candidate - local best)`, `(candidate - neighborhood best)` and `(candidate - global best)`, which makes particles move away from the best solution and leads to poor results and few updates.  \n",
        "   - In my implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization I use `(local best - candidate)`, `(neighborhood best - candidate)` and `(global best - candidate)`, which makes particles move towards the best solutions. With this correction the algorithm shows better and more consistent results with proper convergence behavior and numerous updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The `distribution` argument  \n",
        "   - The base class `FloatVectorCandidate` requires a `distribution` parameter in its constructor.  \n",
        "   - This was not explicitly specified in the project instructions, but without it the code raises an error.  \n",
        "   - For this reason, `self.distribution` is passed around even if it is not directly used in the Particle Swarm Optimizer.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Import Error\n",
        "   - In Google Colab, the library `datasets` comes preinstalled.  \n",
        "   - This causes a dependency conflict with `softpy` because `datasets` requires an older version of `dill`, while `softpy` installs a newer one.  \n",
        "   - Since `datasets` is not needed in this project, I simply uninstall it at the beginning of the notebook. This ensures that `softpy` can be installed without errors and the project runs smoothly."

        "The project successfully implements the **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** algorithm using a custom `ParticleCandidate` class, compatible with the `softpy` framework. Key points from the implementation and testing are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The `ParticleCandidate` class encapsulates the particle's position, velocity, and PSO-specific parameters (`inertia`, `wl`, `wn`, `wg`), providing methods for **mutation**, **recombination**, and **copying**.  \n",
        "- The `ParticleSwarmOptimizer` class handles the overall optimization, maintaining the population, tracking personal and global bests, and updating particles according to the PSO dynamics.  \n",
        "- Adjustments were made to ensure compatibility with `FloatVectorCandidate` (notably passing the `distribution` parameter) and to correct the PSO velocity update formula so that particles move **towards** the best solutions rather than away from them.  \n",
        "- The algorithm was tested on three standard benchmark functions (Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) to verify convergence and behavior across smooth, multi-modal, and curved landscapes, obtaining good results in each case.  \n"
