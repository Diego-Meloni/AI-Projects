# Hopfield Network as Local Optimizer

This repository contains the implementation of a **Hopfield Network** architecture used as a local optimizer for a graph-based classification problem involving author similarity.  
The task was assigned as part of a Deep Learning exam — the full exam description is available in the `exam_test.pdf` file in this folder.

The objective of this project was to reproduce the solution I proposed during the written exam, making only minimal necessary adjustments for execution (performance was not the evaluation criterion).  
The full implementation and analysis can be found in the notebook `Hopfield_Network_Implementation.ipynb`.

Due to GitHub’s file size limitations, the dataset has been divided into five parts. The notebook automatically reconstructs the complete dataset (≈95 MB) upon first execution.  
Running the notebook in **Google Colab** is recommended to handle the download and extraction seamlessly on the server side.
